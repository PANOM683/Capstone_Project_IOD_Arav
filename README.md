# Capstone_Project_IOD_Arav

This is a Project which I have been Working on for a long time. This is only the backend side, the forntend wasn't letting me upload the file because it was to big for git hub. 

My topic is a task website design, it is about a user can actually save anything like full of list can be stored inside the form. My forntend has a Signin form and Signout form, once the user is signin only there list can be seen what they have stored, to see someone else list or anything then they have to login to another user. 

The backend is a crud operation system, that can be upload and stored to mongoDB.

I have used the PUT, DELETE, POST, GET all this work correctly and I have added error fuction which give error if anything is not correct. 

- To run the backend is Simply - go to file backend by (cd backend) 
- then, nodemon app.js in terminal
- then use each operation using thunderbolt in extension of visual studio code.
